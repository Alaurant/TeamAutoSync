# TeamAutoSync

**Introduction**

This project is a demonstration created for the Jenkins organization idea: "Manage jenkinsci GitHub permissions as code" of the 2024 Google Summer of Code. It aims to showcase a simple yet effective approach to managing GitHub permissions programmatically, solve the problem of RPU canâ€™t update or manage repository permission mentioned in the idea.

It's important to note that this demo is a rudimentary representation, aimed at demonstrating potential competencies for tackling the project. The actual implementation for the Jenkins organization will involve more complex scenarios and detailed considerations, far beyond this initial proof of concept.

**Features**

Parsing YAML Files: Dynamically read and parse configurations from YAML files to understand the part of desired state of GitHub teams and permissions in the files.

Automating GitHub Permissions: Utilize the GitHub API to automatically configure roles and permissions based on the parsed YAML configurations, ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state.

**Technology Stack**

Java: The core programming language used for development.
Git: For version control.

Maven: Dependency management and build automation.

SnakeYAML: A YAML processor for the Java Virtual Machine.

GitHub API: Interfacing with GitHub to manage teams and permissions.
